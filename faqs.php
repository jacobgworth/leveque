          <p class="small-paragraph campaign"><strong class="bold-faq">Can I make a recurring donation?<br></strong>Yes you can, <a href="donate.html" class="link-inline">right here</a>.</p>
          <p class="small-paragraph campaign"><strong class="bold-faq">When will I get my video of the completed home?<br></strong>About two months after the home is fully funded. We can’t wait for you to see the tangible impact of your contribution by showing you a video of the <span class="underline">exact</span> family you donated to in their brand new home.</p>
          <p class="small-paragraph campaign"><strong class="bold-faq">Does 100% of my donation really go to the exact family I donated to?<br></strong>Yes. New Story seeks outside investments to fund our operational costs so that we can put every penny you donate to building homes. This is our commitment to our generous donors and to the families we serve.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="w-col w-col-6">

If you are planning to make a gift over $250, it will be easiest if you reach out to <a href="mailto:brett@newstorycharity.org?subject=Tax%20Receipt%20for%20New%20Story" class="link-inline">brett@newstorycharity.org</a> to setup the easiest and quickest way to get your deduction. &nbsp;The <a href="http://www.irs.gov/taxtopics/tc506.html" class="link-inline" target="_blank">IRS</a> only requires you to have a receipt if your gift is over $250.</p>

          <p class="small-paragraph campaign"><strong class="bold-faq">Why did you pick your partner, Mission of Hope?<br></strong>Co-founders Brett and Mike saw the impact of <a href="http://www.mohhaiti.org" class="link-inline" target="_blank">Mission of Hope</a> (MOH) first hand on a missions trip in 2012. This organization has been intimately connected to the community for over a decade and has a local team of contractors ready to build the homes donors help fund. MOH has already built homes with this model and we are confident in the quality of the structures.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="w-col w-col-6">
          <p class="small-paragraph campaign"><strong class="bold-faq">How does New Story hold Mission of Hope accountable?<br></strong>New Story and Mission of Hope have a contract binding us to partnership allegations. We have weekly conversation with Mission of Hope’s Business Development Lead to get what we need (i.e stories, pictures, constructions costs) in order to provide donors with radical transparency.</p>

      <h3 class="faq" id="homes-and-families">Homes and Families</h3>
      <div class="w-row">
        <div class="w-col w-col-6">
          <p class="small-paragraph campaign"><span style="font-size: 19px;"><strong>Why homes?<br></strong></span>Safe shelter is a foundation for upward social and economic mobility. We believe that when families have the security of body and possessions that a home provides, they can focus on actualizing potential instead of fearing theft, illness, and violence.</p>
          <p class="small-paragraph campaign"><span style="font-size: 19px;"><strong>How can a home be built so quickly without compromising quality?<br></strong></span>It’s a very simple concrete, block home consisting of three rooms measuring 16’ by 19’. There is urgency to get homeless families into a safe home - which is why the homes are all built the same way and are quick to build. The home includes a shower with clean sanitation, a toilet and a patio. Mission of Hope has been building these homes for years and they have stood the test of time.</p>
          <p class="small-paragraph campaign"><strong class="bold-faq">Where will the homes be built?<br></strong>The brand new homes funded for our families will be built on a 100 acre plot of land in Leveque, Haiti (<a href="https://www.google.com/maps/place/Leveque,+Haiti/@18.8051453,-72.4878862,21738m/data=!3m1!1e3!4m2!3m1!1s0x8eb763015273d707:0xbfd39221a6756195" class="link-inline" target="_blank">Google Map link</a>).</p>
        </div>
        <div class="w-col w-col-6">
          <p class="small-paragraph campaign"><span style="font-size: 19px;"><strong>Who builds the homes?<br></strong></span>Mission of Hope hires local Haitian contractors that they’ve previously worked with on hundreds of infrastructure projects. It’s a very simple, cookie-cutter process for the homes we’re currently building. A gentleman in Haiti by the name of Augustin Walmy leads this specific project.</p>
          <p class="small-paragraph campaign"><strong class="bold-faq">Who decides which families get a home?<br></strong>We have chosen a local nonprofit partner who has been engaged with the community in Leveque for over a decade. They know the families, their struggles, and their needs. We set basic parameters with which Mission of Hope uses their expertise to hand select families in dire need of homes. There is also a focus on the deaf community. In Haiti, if you’re ‘deaf’ you’re considered an outcast, similar to how leprosy used to be treated. We stand behind Mission of Hope’s radically compassionate goal to help the deaf community. Families are moved from the tent village and deaf community based on a numbered drawing, that seeks to serve both the deaf community and the local tent communities equitably.</p>

        <div class="w-col w-col-6">
          <p class="small-paragraph campaign"><strong class="bold-faq">How did New Story start?<br></strong>When co-founders Mike and Brett volunteered with Mission of Hope in 2012, they were shocked by the level of depravity that residents still lived in 2 years post earthquake. They put together a talented team who are all on a mission to build 200+ homes in one year. Homes are just the beginning of this story.</p>
          <p class="small-paragraph campaign"><strong class="bold-faq">How does New Story create change?<br></strong>We crowdfund homes for families in need around the world. In the short term this provides safety and basic sanitation. In the long term, families are empowered to reach their potential because a home reduces risks of theft, rape, and illness so the family can focus on work and school.</p>
          <p class="small-paragraph campaign"><strong class="bold-faq">How does New Story fund operational costs with a 100% model?<br></strong>We are committed to putting every cent of donor contributions to the building of homes. We fund our day to day operations by generous contributions from investors like DataBlue. If you are interested in investing in our organization, so we can serve even more families, email brett@newstorycharity.org.</p>
          <p class="small-paragraph campaign"><strong class="bold-faq">How can I invest in New Story?<br></strong>Thank you so much for your interest. Investing in New Story powers our ability to help as many communities as possible. To invest in the New Story organization, please contact brett@newstorycharity.org.</p>
          <p class="small-paragraph campaign"><strong class="bold-faq">Do you have a question that we did not answer?</strong>Email <a href="mailto:brett@newstorycharity.org?subject=General%20Question" class="link-inline">brett@newstorycharity.org</a>

          <p class="small-paragraph campaign"><strong class="bold-faq">Who is the team behind this?<br></strong>We have a dedicated and innovative team committed to ending homelessness in developing countries. Check us out <a href="the-team.html" class="link-inline">here</a>.</p>
          <p class="small-paragraph campaign"><strong class="bold-faq">Why doesn’t New Story operate in the United States?<br></strong>While our homeless brothers and sisters around the world could use our help, we are focusing on the developing world because that is where our heart is and where we feel called. Our team has served - and will continue to serve - the homeless in San Francisco and Atlanta, but our core focus is on helping those that have been affected by natural disasters and are living in extreme poverty. Much of Haiti was destroyed by an earthquake in 2010 and about a quarter of the population lives on less than $1 a day, according to The World Bank.</p>
          <p class="small-paragraph campaign"><strong class="bold-faq">Are you a 501(c)(3)?<br></strong>We are pending and expect our status to be approved in the first quarter of 2015. However, we have partnered with a 501(c)(3), Mission of Hope, which allows us to give tax deductible receipts. We have been thrilled with people’s willingness to support our cause and partnering with MOH let’s us begin the work of changing lives without the long 501(c)(3) process getting in the way.</p>
          <p class="small-paragraph campaign"><strong class="bold-faq">How can I get involved?<br></strong>We are in the business of making new stories possible. Join us by donating, creating a campaign, or investing. If you’re interested in joining our team, email brett@newstorycharity.org.</p>
